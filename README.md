<p>This project is an implementation of the Doggame game for the lecture <strong>Software Engineering</strong> at the University of Applied Science Konstanz, Germany.</p>

<p>Main goal of the application is to demonstrate the development of a software project in an agile development methodology. </p>

<p>It shows </p>

<ul>
<li>version control with git </li>
<li>test driven development</li>
<li>layered architecture</li>
<li>metrics with sonar</li>
<li>continuous integration with maven and jenkins</li>
<li>patterns</li>
<li>components and interfaces</li>
</ul><p>The initial user interface is a console-based text UI. Its purpose is to be able to interact with the application as early as possible. 
The Tui is built in a way so that it continues to run in parallel with a GUI or WUI.

The game has been built under Java 1.6. There is currently no .jar availiable, so the game has to be started from Dog.class main in eclipse.
